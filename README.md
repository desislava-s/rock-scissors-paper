## Solution Overview

###  Technologies Used
- **Python 3** → main programming language.
- **Built-in `random` module** → for computer’s random choice.
- **Built-in `sys` module** → to terminate the game on invalid input.

###  Tools Used
- **IDE**: PyCharm
- **GitHub** → host the repository and share the project.

### How It Works
1. The player enters their choice: `[r]ock`, `[s]cissors`, or `[p]aper`.  
2. The computer randomly selects one of the three options.  
3. The game compares the choices:  
   - Rock beats Scissors  
   - Scissors beats Paper  
   - Paper beats Rock  
   - If both choices are the same → draw  
4. The winner is displayed in the console.
